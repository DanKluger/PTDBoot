# PTDBoot

PTDBoot is an R package containing methods conducting leveraging large scale machine learning predictions in downstream statistical inference when a small number of labelled calibration samples are available. The package has functions that implement the Predict-Then-Debias bootstrap algorithms and its extensions from the paper referenced below. 

# Installation and tutorial

You can install the development version of PTDBoot directly from GitHub: 

```r
# install.packages("devtools") # if you don't have it already
devtools::install_github("DanKluger/PTDBoot")
```
